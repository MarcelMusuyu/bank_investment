 In OUR APPLICATION, WE HAVE TAKEN CARE TO CREATE A  virtual environment. This virtual environment, named venv, holds all the required modules.
    AND PACKAGES REQUIRED TO RUN THIS APPLICATION. YOU DONT NEED TO INSTALL THEM
    HERE WE CHOOSE TO USE SQLITE3 DATABASE, IS AN EMBEDDED DATABASE WITH ".db" EXTENSION.
    
    IN ORDER TO HAVE A GRAPHICAL VIEW OF HOW REALLY LOOKS THE bank_investment.db DATABASE AND THE DATA INSIDE IT, 
    
    YOU NEED TO INSTALL A DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, IN OUR CASE IS SQLITE STUDIO https://sqlitestudio.pl/
    UPON COMPLETION OF THE DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM,
        1 CLICK DATABASE
        2 SELECT ADD DATABASE
        3 A NEW WINDOW WILL BE OPENED, BROWSE IN ORDER TO LOCATE THE bank_investment.db FILE THAT IS WITHIN THIS PROJECT
        4 SELECT THE FILE AND CLICK OK, THEN YOU WILL BE TO SEE ALL TABLES AND DATA WHICH ARE IN OUR bank_investment.db DATABASE
        
        TAKE A LOOK TO SOME PICTURES PROVIDED IN THE ROOT DIRECTORY OF THE PROJECT, THEY WILL GIVE YOU AN INSIGHT OF THE PROJECT
        
    THE database_request.py IS OUR CUSTOMIZED MODULE WHERE WE WRITE REQUESTS AND FUNCTIONS RELATED TO OUR DATABASE
    
    THE  bank_investment.py IS FILE THAT CONTAINS THE MAIN FUNCTION TO START OUR PROGRAM

    OTHER CSV, TXT, AND LOG FILES HELP US TO KEEP TRACK OF BUGS NECESSARY FOR TROUBLESHOOTING, STOCK MARKET DATA, AND BANK INVESTMENT DATA
